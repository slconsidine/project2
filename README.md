# Quaran-to-dos
## Created By
Created by Samantha Considine, Vince Casmirri, Amanda Higgins, and Cassandra Heil.

## About
Developed a quarantine to-do list application that would allow users to search movies, books, video games, and songs and add them to their to do list. Users were also able to input their own self care items to the list. 

When tasks are completed, the completed tasks chart fills in with the date and description of the task completed. A timeline graph is also created as tasks are checked off the to do list. 

Additionally, the app allows for users to 'create a new user' so they can keep a personal to do list. The to do list data that is added is specific to the user selected.
